# dbms_partition_wrangler
This project offers fully automated range partitioning for Oracle Database that follows best practices for handling data.

Mission Statement: To help custodians of data that concerns the general public to better manage that data.

Goals:
* Facilitate the uptake of best practices for handling bulk data in an Oracle Database.
* Facilitate the purging of that data when it is no longer of relevance and there is no justification for its retention by the data controller.
* Faciliate the reduction of online storage, archive storage, backup storage, compute, and electricity consumption that is incurred by hosting the data set.
* Facilitate performance improvements for the online processing of large data sets.
* Encourage the use of security controls such as encrpytion and auditing to protect data.

Intended Audience:
* Data processors in retail, healthcare, telecommunications, utilities, transportation, hospitality, hotels, and financial services, among others, more often than not store bulk personal data in an Oracle Database.

Why: Because there is no consistency in how data controllers and data processors that handle bulk data correctly or optimally, and perhaps out of compliance with legislation such as GDPR, because it is difficult. And because mass data leaks are occurring regularly and often concerns data that should not have have been retained once it is no longer of use.
